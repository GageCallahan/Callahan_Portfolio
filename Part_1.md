# Final Project Part1 - What a Declining Population Could Mean For You

## Outline
I am interested in showing the data that shows/predicts the declining population growth rates and eventual predicted population decline by the end of the century.
I think this data is not discussed that much because it is a far off projection, but it could cause significant changes throughout the world.

### Based on this topic there are two issues:
  1) This is broad demographic data which was suggested not to do!
Because of this I am going to try and limit the scope of my story and focus on something that could be engaging and relevent to the audience. Hence "What [it] could mean for YOU"
  2) This topic could lend itself to doomsaying or making wild projections.
My goal to avoid this is to keep everything grounded in real world data and trends, and try to minimize reliance on projections.
Additionally, I would like to contextualize the story with nuance and optimism rather than anything too dire.

Expected project flow:
First lay the foundation. Ill expect some in the audience to have heard this data before, but I should introduce it in a way that accepts a broad audience.
Show the world population and birthrate trends to establish that population is decreasing. Some future projection will probably be used here.

## Sketches

## Data
The primary data used for this project will be Population//Birth Rates by country and year(also includes demographic breakdowns)
This data is available from the [UN's Demographic Indicators](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/)
This is the data that I think is most essential to tell my story and will be included prominantly.

This data source is useful because it is used for working with population trends which is what I am using it for. Because of this it contains other useful information such as migration and life expectancy data. I am particularly interested in using the migration data because one of the best ways a country can maintain economic growth through declining birth rates is through large immigration. Life expectancy data is also important because it highlights the point 
of the population demographic shift (inverted pyramid) as well as being a key element to the positive spin (we are living longer) I want to include.

Currently I am interested in two other datasets for supporting analysis.
First, the [OECD Population data](https://data.oecd.org/pop/population.htm), which allows for more granular breakdown
of age groups for OECD countries. This will not be the focus because I think looking at data for all countries is more important. Regardless using this
as a supporting graph could emphasize the demographic shifts.
Second, [this](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394943/retiring-planning-retire-later.aspx) gallop poll includes retirement age information for the United States.
The "Get the Data" link in the bottom corner of the graphic on this page will download the relevant csv file.
I think this information would have value as supporting information because retirement is a key part of the population shift impact, even though this only shows U.S. data.

## Method and Medium

I enjoyed the examples we saw on shorthand am I am excited to create my project using that source. This will be good to create the flow through the story as I imagine it.
As for the inclass presentation, I may use a smaller version of the shorthand project or have something like a video to ensure I get the points I want across in a minute.
