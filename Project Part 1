# Final Project Part1 - What a Declining Population Could Mean For You

##Outline
I am interested in showing the data that shows/predicts the declining population growth rates and eventual predicted population decline by the end of the century.
I think this data is not discussed that much because it is a far off projection, but it could cause significant changes throughout the world.

###Based on this topic there are two issues:
  1) This is broad demographic data which was suggested not to do!
Because of this I am going to try and limit the scope of my story and focus on something that could be engaging and relevent to the audience. Hence "What [it] could mean for YOU"
  2) This topic could lend itself to doomsaying or making wild projections.
My goal to avoid this is to keep everything grounded in real world data and trends, and try to minimize reliance on projections.
Additionally, I would like to contextualize the story with nuance and optimism rather than anything too dire.

Expected project flow:
First lay the foundation. Ill expect some in the audience to have heard this data before, but I should introduce it in a way that accepts a broad audience.
Show the world population and birthrate trends to establish that population is decreasing. Some future projection will probably be used here.

##Sketches

##Data

###Primary Data
This is the data that I think is most essential to tell my story and will be included prominantly.
Population//Birth Rates by country and year(also includes demographic breakdowns) https://data.oecd.org/pop/population.htm

Retirement Age (US)

GDP https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm

##Method and Medium

I enjoyed the examples we saw on shorthand am I am excited to create my project using that source. This will be good to create the flow through the story as I imagine it.
As for the inclass presentation, I may use a smaller version of the shorthand project or have something like a video to ensure I get the points I want across in a minute.
