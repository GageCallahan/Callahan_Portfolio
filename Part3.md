# Changes made since Part II

## Expanded Detail and Call to Action

A big gap in the part ii submission was that alot of the text that would elaborate or explain the story was placeholder text instead. For the final submission, I went back in and cleaned all of this up and provided the details of the story. I was able to use feedback from part ii to identify the areas that my interviewees desired more elaboration on such as notes on policies and causes. Ultimately this step was not too difficult as most of the gaps were left in areas that had very leading headers or were somewhat obvious so I could fill them in quickly. Along the way this allowed for more chances to include some small data highlights to support my arguments (such as getting a cost estimate in the "Causes to Target" section.) I was also able to use the extra text to manage transitions between topics and expand upon the blue/pink color theming by highlighting key portions of the text. The one area where this was not true was for the Call To Action. I had decided on the audiences I wanted to target and I had some idea of the sentiments I wanted each audience to take away, but I did not have any idea how to put this into concrete form for the call to action. I will discuss more about this process in "The Audience" section below.

## Structural/Flow Changes

Another issue that came up during my interviews was some friction points for the presentation's flow. The two identified moments were the introduction/global trends portion, and "The Cure"/fertility gap sections. One note was that I originally had the definition of the Fertility Gap twice, once in the intro and once in the dedicated section later. My intention with this was that the intro could function as a sort of abstract for the story and give all the necessary information up front. This ended up being confusing for the audience so I reduced detail in the intro and left the term-defining for later. The other notes about the intro both refererred to my first graph about the global population trends. One person felt like the graph came out of nowhere and they were not adequately prepared to understand it so it took them a bit to refocus. The other note was that the graph focused on global trends when the overall story had a focus on the United States. Ultimately I tried to manage this by including some more explanatory text around the graph and including a second graph that focused on the U.S. situation. I think ultimately this helped the flow by starting global and narrowing in to the lens of the story. The fertility gap section ended up being very difficult to place in a way that fit the flow of the story. On one hand, it was _the key_ to the story so I wanted to bring it up as early as possible. On the other hand, the structure I had built of intoducing the problem, going over bad solutions, then arriving at the final solution really wanted the fertility gap section to be towards the end and it did not _need_ to be brought up earlier for any other points to make sense. While I tried it out in a few different spots and even toyed with inverting the structure (presenting "the cure" first and then going over the other, less appealing approaches), I ended up putting it right before the Call to Action as a sort of "everything has been leading to this" or "save the best for last" approach. My lasting concern with this choice is that it takes a quite a bit to really get to the main takeaway of the story and then it ends abruptly.

## Additional Visualizations
In the process of fixing the flow and adding more detail/supporting evidence, I was drawn to include some more visualizations. As previously stated I duplicated my world population trends graph from the beginning with a focus on the U.S. which was as simple as changing the filter in my dataset. I think including both the local and global charts is still important as the large immigration in the U.S. could make the problem not seem important if the U.S. graph was presented on its own. Because multiple interviewees wanted some more elaboration on policy, I also build a visualization on the potential costs of a cash-incentive based pro-natal policy approach in the "Approach 2: The Painkiller" section. While this visualization was probably the least intuitive I included, I think it helps to give support and grounding to my claims of this approach being infeasible. I also considered using just a simple spreasheet of this data instead of a visualization (as the original source did), but I thought this bar chart method worked to stay in the visual theme of the story and to allow visual comparisons of the short-term and long-term policy costs.

## The audience
From the interview process I locked in the audience I had already assumed: Policy Makers #1, Business Leaders #2 and Individuals #3. The order of importance reflects a focus on the audience who would be most willing and able to effect this issue. My interviews confirmed that the topic seemed relevant to all audiences, so I focused efforts on building out concrete and targeted calls to action. For policy makers, I outlined the key points of my presentation as components of policies that they should support in the future. Since this was pretty abstract, I also used legiscan.com to find current congressional bills and resolutions that related to this topic to provide concrete examples of what to support. For business leaders, the call to action was pretty simple: be supportive to families. I was able to find two good sources for business leaders to use to build family friendly policies into their business. For individuals, the key was their role in changing social norms. I also noted the individuals role in supporting these policies through voting. Individuals can mostly only impact this issue through collective action, but to give some actionable guidance, I included information on charities that support families in need as this is a related way to manage this issue in the short-term.

# Final Decisions and Unmade Changes

In addition to the previously mentioned changes, I made some minor changes to word choices/grammar and changed the colors on some of the graphs to match the color scheme. I struggled a bit with the background colors of the story panels because I wanted to have variety while not being jarring or distracting. I landed on only varying the color on the first few panels, and then keeping the white background for the more detailed discussions. On my "Demographic Shift" dual pyramid chart I wanted to use color to portray more information as suggessted in my part ii graded feedback or just to change the color to the blue/pink scheme. Unfotunately I could not figure out how to change these colors in flourish easily. Multiple members wanted more detail on policies and while I tried to follow this to an extent, I wanted to limit this story to an overview of the issue. Ultimately diving into the pros and cons of individual policies was outside of my scope. Currently there is no large U.S. effort to combat this issue so I did not have a policy initiative to base the details around. The last thing I did not end up including was an immigration map, as shown in the part i sketches. This would show why a focus on immigration as a band-aid solution would not work in the long-run. I did not include the map because I thought the presentation was able to get this data across well without its inclusion. The map would look cool, but would ultimately be a bit of fluff for what is a minor point in the long run.
