[final project I](https://gagecallahan.github.io/Callahan_Portfolio/Part_1.html)

# Wireframes / storyboards

As recommended in class, I moved to shorthand for the storyboarding step. This was helpful as I was able to see the layout tools I had at my disposal and work within those limits. It is also naturally pleasant to look at which helped the interview process.
For the Wireframes, I built all of my most important and necessary graphics using the real data in flourish. They are closer to rough drafts/final products but that should help me going forward.

# User research 

## Target audience
I think my story has three target audiences. In declining order of importance we have policy makers, business leaders, and general public. I also am specifically focusing on the US for this presentation as a way to narrow my scope so I targeted only US citizens. While I was not able to reasonably target actual policy makers and business leaders in a short time frame, I targeted those who either had some experience working in public policy or that I thought could put themselves in those shoes based on their academic background. Thankfully Heinz is good location for this data. I think this topic is relevant to all, but I chose to interview two woman and one man because I am a man and I wanted to make sure a topic that touches heavily on fertility had proper feedback from women.

## Interview script

**Goal:** Check if the presentation could be followed and that ideas were organized in a logical manner. Basic sanity check.

**Q1:** Structure and Flow: How well could you follow the structure laid out in the storyboard? What are your opinions on the presentation flow.

**Goal:** I was worried with this topic that I would not be able to make it speak to the audience. This question hopes to address that and also ties directly into my target audience.

**Q2:** Relevance and Connection: Did you feel like the topic was important or relevant enough to hold your interest? Did you feel like it was relevant to you personally or that it would be relevant to policy makers and business leaders?

**Goal:** This question should keep all the design stuff related to shortand in one area. I am very interested in feedback here because I am inexperienced and have no design background. However, since this the design deicions made were not final I wanted to limit feeback pertaining to them in one question

**Q3:** Style and Design: What are your opinions on the overall use of stylistic elements such as layout, color, and images.

**Goal:** This question focuses on the wireframes and the effectiveness of the indvidual visualizations I used. Even though they are embedded in the flow of the story I want to get feedback on the visualizations themselves in isolation.

**Q4:** Individual Critiques: What are some positive and negative comments towards the data visualizations presented.

**Goal:** Again a bit of a sanity check, but I wanted to probe others minds for some idea of what I could add. This should catch if anything obvious is missing but might also include some bright ideas to help the presentation.

**Q5:** Missing: Other than filling out the general text of the project, what do you think would be a good or necessary addition to improve your understanding or experience. Also let me know if you could not understand it in the current form due to the placeholder text.

**Goal:** This is just a catch all for people to write whatver they want. I hate when these questions are not included.

**Q6:** General Comments: Anything Else you would like to bring to my attention?

## Interview findings

Individual 1: 26 M, Economics Background, Familiar with Course

* **Q1** The flow works, I think tying the actions that can be taken with the type of solutions might be useful if possible
* **Q2** Yeah it seemed interesting, maybe less relevant to me personally but policies related to it are always relevant
* **Q3** I liked it, the second image of the old guy looking surprised did not fit the tone but otherwise it felt solid
* **Q4** The projected part of the data seemed slightly goofy where it is just a straight line for the fertility rates, but otherwise they all looked good. I think the replacement rate line in all the graphs was particularly useful
* **Q5** Hard to say without the specifics in the sections expanded upon. I do think tying the solutions offered and the how to section will be important. I think pointing out what type of solution each policy/action might aim to and a discussion of if that's more or less helpful might be an idea
* **Q6** Not really

Individual 2: 27 F, Familiar with Course

* **Q1** I think the overall layout and flow is pretty good. It's not boring.
* **Q2** I do! I think it should be extremely relevent to policy makers and have a lot of opinions on this topic. I'd like to see more on the gap between desired and actual fertility rate, but maybe more will be added when you put in more text. I think that a mention of current policies that are potentially discouraging family growth are worth mentioning.
* **Q3** The starting picture grabbed my attention. I thought the light pink and blue theme was cute, seeing as how the topic is population growth
* **Q4** I wasn't quite sure what was going on in the first one right away -- maybe consider contextualizing it a bit more. I liked the second visualization.
* **Q5** I'm surprised you didn't bring up GPD growth and the challenge that an ageing population poses to growth. China is experiencing that problem acutely due to decades of the one-child policy, and while this is a US-focused presentation, I think that this potential issue we could face due to low fertility is possibly more concerning than some of the other problems you brought up.
* **Q6** The section, in the Cure section, had four panels. It didn't work well when I didn't have my browser in full screen. Maybe something to check on for your final design?

Individual 3: 27 F, Policy Background, Unfamiliar with Course

* **Q1** Structure and flow was very good. I would maybe put some sort of note in the overview about what you're going to be discussing in the rest of the presentation. The only thing that I felt broke up the "flow" a little was the reiteration of what the fertility gap is between approach 2 and 3. 
* **Q2** Definitely a relevant topic, and one that I often see talked about in the news, so I think it is relevant to policy makers and business leaders. Without the filled in text, it does seem a little bit that it's just a woman's issue, when I think that maybe there is a lot more going on than just women aren't having as many kids as they would like. 
* **Q3** I liked the use of pink and blue to be "boy/girl" as I interpreted it. I think changing up some fonts/styles helps hold my focus on what I am reading without becoming overly distracting. 
* **Q4** Positive: data visualizations were very clear and easy to understand for someone not familiar with the topic, especially the graphs. where there are parts that haven't been filled in, I would maybe be interested in seeing more graphs/data visualizations to really bring the point home. 
* **Q5** It seems to me in general that approach 3 is the only "real" solution being presented. I am curious to know more about why approach 1 and 2 would be included as possible options, or if they are just there to make it clear that option 3 is the only choice. 
* **Q6** A few small spelling and grammar mistakes. "Aging" doesn't have an E in the US. Where it says "What is the fertility gap" I would put a question mark. and sometimes shift randomly from capitalization to not capitalization. I don't know where to put this, but it seems a little bit like you are trying to focus the point on this being a US issue, but some of your data and graphs talk about a world population and what other countries are doing. I would maybe sort of talk broadly if you're going to, and then bring your point back to the US

Overall Insights

* Generally positive feedback towards the layout and flow. I think there is a balance between what information to include in the overview and when/if to reiterate it that needs to be played with.
* At least through these interviews there was success in connecting to the audience. 2 and 3 both mentioned they wanted to see more in the text here so I should make sure that the text included builds off the relevance/connection built so far.
* Positive feeback towards the blue/pink theme and the data visualizations.
* Contextualization and prepping the audience is important to flow. 2 and 3 mentioned some desire for more context/intro at points.
* 1 and 2 desire information on specific policies. This is a good point since the presentation stays pretty broad.
* 2 and 3 talk about discussing the more details (GDP growth and causes of fertility gap) that I should be sure to expand on.
* Not alot of contradictions, but one that potentially popped out was how much to tie in the global information. 2 specifally mentioned China as an example that would be good to reference while 3 thought the use of global vs US statistics 

# Identified changes for Part III

My biggest goal moving in to part iii is choosing when and how to include more details. Some people really have the desire for more information, visualizations, data etc. but too much of it will disrupt the flow. Improving the couple of hiccups I have with the flow currently and keeping it engaging should be a top priority. One detail I am looking to include is a breakdown of a few actual policies that have been implemented globablly and in the US as a sort of grounding for the presentation. This would likely be either at the very end, with the 'Painkiller' section, or mixed in both spots.

As for design, I want to carefully pick and use the colors and images that support my story. I like the goofy man image, but I agree with 1 that it goes against the rest of the theme. I got support for the pink/blue theme but I definitely don't want to overdue this and start changing background colors. One thing is to go into my flourish visualizations and change the dark blue to the lighter baby blue that I use to highlight some text.

Finally, I want to pay special attention to the call to action section at the end of the presentation. I left this as placeholder text because I did not think it crucial to the storyboard or wireframes, but for the final presentation this portion should be very refined. A poor call to action could disrupt the entire presention flow.
