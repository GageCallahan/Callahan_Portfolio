Gage Callahan: Public Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU.

# About Me
Hello I am Gage Callahan (he/him/his) and I am in the MISM-BIDA program. I am a member of the U.S. Army and will be working in Pittsburgh following graduation for Army AI and data projects.

# What I Hope to Learn
I am very excited to learn and apply data visualization techniques in this class. Data presentation can be a powerful tool for good, bad, or confusing outcomes and I think being on the good side of this spectrum will be helpful in my future work. I am also interested to develop my critique skills and learn to avoid common data-vis traps that I'm sure I've made in the past.
