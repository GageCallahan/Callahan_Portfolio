# Written Summary

The data used from OECD shows the ratio of each countries debt to GDP ratio (as a percent) over the years 1995-2022. Not all countries have data for every year. Many countries do not have data for 2022, so this column was not included in the visualizations.
For the first visualization I limited the data shown to just 2018. I like the use of bolding the average as it draws the eyes to the center and allows us to visualize the distribution and see the clear outliers. I think this simple approach is good to immediately capture the data from one year, but doesn't tell as interesting of a story as including information over time. I though it was strange to include OECD-Total and not highlight that bar as well. 
The sparkline visualization is really great for comparing the shape of each country's path and noticing macro trends and places where countries stand out. For example many countries show the spike-then-dip at 2020 during the height of the COVID pandemic. Among all countries, Japan stands out the most due to their consistant steep climbing of debt.
For my third visualization, I wanted to do a little more with looking at change over time and saw that Flourish supported the animated race chart. This required reformatting the data a bit and finding flag images online, but I liked the end result. To keep the plot clean, the visualization has access to all the data, but only the top 10 countries are shown at any given time. The animation makes this chart interesting and shows some differences between countries well. It is especially good at drawing attention to the movement at the top three, highlighting Japan, Greece, and Italy. Compared to the sparklines, this method is less suited to examining trends across all countries due to the constant movement, rescaling, and inability to see all the data at once. For example the COVID spike is not clearly visible on the timelapse unless you are looking for it. Originally I left all bars in the same color. However, in the spirit of the assignment, I tried to assign each country a category color that fit their flag colors but left the flag visible. Doing this while maintaining distinct categories was difficult because many countries have very similar color schemes on their flags.
